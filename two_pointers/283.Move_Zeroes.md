### **Problem: Move Zeroes**

**Goal**: Given an input list of integers **`nums`**, move all 0 elements to the end of the list while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

- **Definition of a Zero**: Any element equal to 0.
- **Element Separation**: Elements in **`nums`** are separated by at least one position.
- **Objective**: Modify the input list **`nums`** in-place to move all zeros to the end, ensuring that the order of non-zero elements remains unchanged.

**Input Format**: A list of integers **`nums`**.

**Output Format**: The modified list **`nums`** with all zeros moved to the end.

### **Example**

For an input list:

```python
nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
The expected result would be:


[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
Approach
You plan to solve this problem using a two-pointer technique to achieve an efficient in-place solution.

Understanding the Constraints:
In-Place Modification: The list must be modified without using extra space for another list.
Maintaining Order: The relative order of non-zero elements should remain unchanged.
Efficiency: Aim for an O(n) time complexity.
Initial Thought Process:
Two Pointers (i and j):

Pointer i: Tracks the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.
Pointer j: Iterates through the list to find non-zero elements.
Logic:

Iterate through the list with pointer j.
When a non-zero element is found at nums[j], swap it with nums[i].
Increment both pointers accordingly.
Pseudocode:


Function moveZeroes(nums: List[int]) -> None:
    n = len(nums)
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if nums[j] != 0:
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            i += 1
Explanation:
Initialize i to 0.
Iterate through the list with j.
When a non-zero is found, swap it with the element at index i.
Increment i to point to the next position for a non-zero element.
Key Points
Two-Pointer Technique: Efficiently track and place non-zero elements.
In-Place Modification: Swapping elements without using additional space.
Maintaining Order: Ensuring that the relative order of non-zero elements remains unchanged.
Time Complexity: Achieves O(n) by processing each element exactly once.
Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses only constant extra space.
Feedback on Pseudocode
Your pseudocode is almost correct but has a minor issue in the loop variable. Here’s the feedback:

Loop Variable Correction: In your initial pseudocode, you used for i in range(n):, which incorrectly uses i as the loop variable. It should be for j in range(n): to iterate with pointer j.
Return Statement: Since the modification is in-place, there's no need to return nums.
Finalized Pseudocode:


Function moveZeroes(nums: List[int]) -> None:
    n = len(nums)
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if nums[j] != 0:
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            i += 1
Manual Execution Example
Using the example nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]:

Initial State: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], i = 0

Iteration 1 (j = 0):
nums[j] = 0 (zero), no swap.
i remains 0.
Iteration 2 (j = 1):
nums[j] = 1 (non-zero).
Swap nums[i] and nums[j] → nums = [1, 0, 0, 3, 12].
Increment i to 1.
Iteration 3 (j = 2):
nums[j] = 0 (zero), no swap.
i remains 1.
Iteration 4 (j = 3):
nums[j] = 3 (non-zero).
Swap nums[i] and nums[j] → nums = [1, 3, 0, 0, 12].
Increment i to 2.
Iteration 5 (j = 4):
nums[j] = 12 (non-zero).
Swap nums[i] and nums[j] → nums = [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].
Increment i to 3.
Final State: nums = [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
All zeros have been moved to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

Final Solution
Below is the final Python implementation of the Move Zeroes problem using the two-pointer technique:


# 283. Move Zeroes.py

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Move all zeros in 'nums' to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.
        This is done in-place without making a copy of the array.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        i = 0  # Pointer for the position of the next non-zero element
        for j in range(n):
            if nums[j] != 0:
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
                i += 1
        # No return statement needed as the list is modified in-place
How to Use
Instantiate the Solution Class:

solution = Solution()
Call the moveZeroes Method:

nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
solution.moveZeroes(nums)
print(nums)  # Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
Summary
Your approach effectively uses the two-pointer technique to solve the Move Zeroes problem with optimal time and space complexity. By carefully tracking the position for the next non-zero element and iterating through the list, all zeros are moved to the end in a single pass without disrupting the order of non-zero elements.
