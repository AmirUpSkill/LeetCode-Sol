### Problem Statement: "Longest Repeating Character Replacement"

**Objective**:  
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you can replace any character in the string with any other uppercase English character. You are allowed to perform this replacement operation at most `k` times.  

**Goal**:  
Return the length of the longest substring you can achieve where all characters are the same after performing the above operations.

### Example:  

Input:  
```plaintext
s = "ABABBA", k = 2
```

**How to Approach?**  
1. First, check if a substring is valid.  
   - **Definition of Valid Substring**:  
     A substring is valid if the following condition holds:  
     \[
     \text{length of substring} - \text{frequency of the most frequent character} \leq k
     \]
     This formula ensures that you can convert the remaining characters in the substring to match the most frequent character using at most `k` replacements.

---

### Steps to Solve:
1. **Efficiently Check All Substrings**:  
   Use the **sliding window technique** with two pointers (`left` and `right`) to scan substrings without recalculating everything repeatedly.

2. **Track the Most Frequent Character**:  
   Use a **hashmap** (or dictionary) to store the frequency of each character in the current window.

3. **Initialize and Update the Longest Substring**:  
   - Start with a variable called `longest`, initialized to 0.
   - Update `longest` whenever a valid substring is found.

4. **Expand or Shrink the Window**:  
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer.
   - If the current substring is invalid (based on the condition above), shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer.

### Code (Starting Point):

```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        left = 0
        longest = 0
        char_count = {}
        
        for right in range(n):
            # Add current character to the hashmap
            char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1
            
            # Check if the window is valid
            while (right - left + 1) - max(char_count.values()) > k:
                # Shrink the window from the left
                char_count[s[left]] -= 1
                if char_count[s[left]] == 0:
                    del char_count[s[left]]
                left += 1
            
            # Update the longest valid substring
            longest = max(longest, right - left + 1)
        
        return longest
```

This implementation efficiently calculates the longest substring using the sliding window technique and ensures we only calculate frequencies for the current window.
